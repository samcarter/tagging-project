Every spring, thevillagers gather to cel-ebratetheFestivalofBlooms,a vibrant event markedby an explosion of col-ors and scents. The fes-tival centers around thecompetition of floral ar-rangements, where par-ticipants fromallagegroupsdisplay their creativitywith flowers handpickedfromthesurrounding woods.The air is filled with thesweet fragrance of wild roses, lilacs, and jasmine, mingling with the sound oflaughter and folk music. Children dart between stalls, their faces painted withpetal motifs, while elders share stories of festivals past. The highlight of theevent is the crowning of the Bloom Queen, a title bestowed upon the creatorof the most breathtaking floral display.
